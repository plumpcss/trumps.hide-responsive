#Hide-responsive

The plumpcss `hide-responsive` module is an extension of the default [`hide`
module](https://github.com/plumpcss/trumps.hide).
Install using Bower:

    $ bower install --save plumpcss-hide-responsive

`hide-responsive` loops through the breakpoints defined in
`settings.responsive` to generate prefixed breakpoint-based classes. If you are
using plumpcssâ€™ default breakpoints, you will be given classes like
`hide-lap-and-up`, or `hide-desk`, etc.
